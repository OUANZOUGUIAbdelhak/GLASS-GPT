# 🧪 Predicting Initial Dissolution Rates of Glasses Using AI

Welcome! This repository documents a complete AI-driven workflow developed during a **one-year gap-year internship**, focused on **automating data extraction from scientific articles** to create a database for modeling the **initial dissolution rate of glasses**—a critical property for materials used in **nuclear waste containment**.

> 🧠 **Goal**: Extract and structure glass composition and experimental parameters from PDF articles using **LLMs, Langflow, OCR, and custom Python scripts**, and use this data to **train a model to predict the initial dissolution rate** of glass under various conditions.

## 🔬 Project Background

In the context of nuclear waste storage, glass is used to immobilize radioactive materials. Predicting how this glass alters (dissolves) over time in various conditions is essential for long-term safety.

The **initial dissolution rate** is one of the key metrics, but gathering experimental data on this is difficult due to:

* Scattered information across decades of publications
* Lack of structured datasets
* Variability in composition formats and testing conditions

## 🧠 AI/ML Techniques

* **Document Question Answering** via Langflow

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### Step 1: Article Collection & OCR

* Collected \~50+ articles from:

  * ScienceDirect
  * Google Scholar
  * Web of Science
  * Supervisor suggestions
* Used **Docling** and a lab OCR printer to digitize 3 scanned papers

### Step 2: Relevance Check via LLM Prompting

Used Langflow + LLM with a strict **specification sheet prompt** to ensure each article includes:

* Full glass composition (\~100%)
* Explicit initial dissolution rate (with unit)
* At least one experimental parameter (e.g., pH, temperature)

📄 **Output**: `articles/valid_articles_metadata.json`
🟢 20 valid articles (out of 50+ reviewed)

### Step 3: Glass List Extraction

Extracted names of glasses with valid data using LLM, e.g.:

```
1. glass_1: NBS14/18
2. glass_2: NBSA
3. glass_3: NBSC
...
```

### Step 4: Composition Extraction & Conversion

LLM prompts extract **composition in various units** → then converted using:

* `convert_composition.py`
* Output: **mol% of elements** (Si, O, B, Na, etc.)

### Step 5: Full Parameter Extraction

For each test on each glass:

* Composition (mol%)
* Experimental conditions
* Initial rate (V₀ or r₀)
* Other metadata (irradiation, polishing, BET surface...)

🔢 Output: structured row for each glass-test combination (107 parameters)

### Step 6: Populate the Database

* All cleaned data is inserted into an SQL database
* Converted to CSV: `data/final_dataset.csv`

### Step 7: Model Training

* Used `notebooks/03_model_training.ipynb`
* Feature engineering on mol% + key conditions
* Trained regression model (e.g., RandomForestRegressor)
* Output: `models/trained_model.pkl`

---

## 📊 Final Dataset & Modeling

* ✅ 20 validated papers
* 🧪 70+ unique tests on glasses
* 🧾 107 parameters per test
* 📈 Model performance: \[to be filled after training]
